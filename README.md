#**PCOS Detection Using Machine Learning**

##**Overview**

This project aims to develop a Machine Learning-based predictive model for detecting Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using medical datasets. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and contains relevant health indicators for early diagnosis. The implementation involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using various machine-learning techniques.
